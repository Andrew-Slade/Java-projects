###Day Split 1
***

- notes available online

- class:
	1. class methods
	2. class variables
- standard object oriented concepts present


			System.out.print() - prints information
			System.out.println() - prints information on a new line
			System.out.printf() - print formated ( C esque)
	
- no such thing as a standalone function in java
- default constructors provided
- declaring instance:

			Classname name = new Classname();
			
- so:
	
			class BicycleDemo{
				public static void main(String[] args){
					Bicycle bike1 = new Bicycle();
			
					bike1.speedUp(50); // invoke a method				
				}	
			}
			
- then:

	1. file names: Bicycle.java     BicycleDemo.java
	2. compile: javac Bicycle.java BicycleDemo.java
	3. compiled to: Bicycle.class   BicycleDemo.class
	4. then to execute: java BicycleDemo
	
- this completes the process

- classes can instantiate themselves
- inheritence:

			class derivedname extends baseclass{}

- importing:

			import javax.swing.JButton; - imports a specific package
			import javax.swing.*; - imports a specific class
			
- there is no size difference

- no prototypes except in specific cases
- interfaces:
>> a group of related methods with empty bodies

- implementation:
			
		class className implements baseclass{}

***

###Day Split 2
***

- data types
	1. byte - 8 bit signed integer
	2. short - 16 byte signed integer
	3. int - integer
	4. long - 64 byte signed integer
	5. float 
	6. double
	7. char
	8. bool - 16-byte  unicode
	
- default value for bool is false 
- other defaults often null
- local variables are not initialized
- literals are defined the same as in C

- arrays
>> size determined at runtime

- ie
	
		int[] scores; // an uninitialized array
		scores = new int[6]; // initialize array
		scores[0] = 10; // initialize first element

- also
		
		int[] anArray = {100, 200
						300, 400
						500, 600	} 

- there is no way to alter an array once it is initialized
- multidimensional arrays are the same as in C++
- ie

		int [][] scores = {	{1,3,5},
						{2,4,6}	};
- this method is considered best practice

***

###Day Split 3
***

- for statements work the same
- ie

		int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5};
		for(int item : numbers){
		     ....
		}

- standard order for attributes is generally as main is declared:  
>> Public static void main =>  access -> continuity -> type -> identifier
- final is an attribute
- methods
		
		public double calculateAnswer(double a, int b){
			...
		}
 
- may have to define exceptions
- there is no const attribute
- final attribute means that the method cannot be overriden by subclasses
- overload a method -- create a method with the same name as an existing method in this class (or one of the superclasses)
>> however, different parameters 
- override a method 
>> create a new method for a class that has the 
>> same name and parameters of the 
>> superclass' method ( returns type may be !=)
- constructors still return nothing
- objects defined thus
		
		className newInstanceName = new className(params);
		
- constructors not necessary
>> if constructor written, then default constructor necessary
- superclass constructor called thus

		super(); //done at the top of the method
		
		//for example
		
		public Dog(int age,....){
			super(age);
		};
		
- pointer to array:

		Point[] 
		
- built in types passed by reference
- objects can be passed as parameters
- when you return an object, return new object. ie:

		return new Circle();
		

***

###Day Split 4
***

- arrow operand does not exist, dot operand does
			
		arrow.length()
		//not
		arrow->length()

- this keyword does exist
- package statements go at the top
- static initialization block
		
		static{
		 code for initializing variables like arrays
		}
		
- there can be many of these
- initializer block

		{
		 code here
		}
		
- lambdas exist as well

***

###Day Split 5
***

- comparitor class is a easy way to shorten comparing for sorting
- class document for comparitor 
>> example is directly related to current assignment
- try-catch blocks are good for specific instances such as file manipulation
- superclass Exception matches all 
>> exception types, so put it last, also great for tests
- can rethrow errors to throw them to the next method 
- file scanner

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(args[0]))

- do this in a try catch block for file not found exception
- File class and Scanner class hold the libs for this

***

###Day Split 6
***

- graphical user interfaces are either
>> java.awt.* or import.javax.swing.* and .event.* for events
- applications vs applets 
>> applets - java program on a webpage 
>>		- run in browser
>>		- are embedded in html code
>>		- subclass of JApplet
>>		- no main() method use init() instead
- applets also have start(), stop() which are called when page loads and leaves

>> application - standard application subclasses or instances of JFrame
>>	- setDefaultCloseOperation(int op) - usually, 
>>	- usually, javax.swing.WindowsConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE  
>>        usually used on main window
>>      - sometimes, DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE, HIDE_ON_CLOSE, or DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE
>>	- use setSize() and/or setMinimumSize() to set window size at startup
>>	- setVisible(Boolean visible) - makes window visible NECESARY
>>	- also, JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE

- adding to the content pane isn't always necessary 
- use add to add things to the content pane
- addActionListener(this) - adds a listener to handle events 

***
###Day Split 7
***

- alpha is transparency
- alpha = 1 is completely opaque 0 is transparent

***
###Day Split 8
***

- When the user indicates text entry is complete(enter)
>> the text field sets an actionevent
- boderfactory class is good for bordering things
- Pressing a button instantiated by the Jbutton class sets an actionevent
- Jtextarea -- multi-line text component
- does not manage scrolling, but implements scrollable intergace
- setText()/ getText()
- setLineWrap/setWrapStyleWord
- append() - add string to end of existing text
- insert(string str, int position)
- default behavior of a text area is to grow to accomodate text placed in it 

***
###Day Split 9
***

- JscrollPane 
>> provides a scrollable view of a component such as JTextArea or Jlist

- regarding assignment 2
- Jlist
>> A component that displays a list of objects and allows the user to select
>> one or more items

- ex
		
		JList(E[] listData)
		JList(ListModel<E> dataModel)
		JList(Vector<? extends E> listData)

- void setVisibleRowCount(int visibleRowNumber)
>> sets visible row count, which has different meanings depending on 
>> orientation. For a vertical layout(default), this sets preferred number
>> of rows to display without scrolling. For other orientations, it affects
>> the wrapping of cells.

- void setFixedCellWidth(int width) - sets the cell value as fixed
- void setLayoutOrientation(int layout) -- sets orientation 
>> there are (vert, vert wrap, horizontal)
- void addListSelectionListener(ListSelectionListener listener)
>> adds a listener for listselectionevents, callback method:
>> public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent e)

***
###Day Split 10
***

- Gui layout doesn't have to be the same as his
- JSpinner
		
		String[] monthStrings = get.MonthStrings();
		SpinnerListModel monthModel=new SpinnerListModel(monthStrings);
		JSpinner monthSpinner = new JSpinner(monthModel);

- above creates a spinner with months

		Object getValue(); //returns currently displayed object
		//need to typecast to use as a string
		//ie
		String departureMonth = (String) monthSpinner.getValue();

- changing spinner's model sets a ChangeEvent detected with
>> changeEventListener, the callback method is called

		public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e);

- good error to catch is if they do not enter miles --default 0
- events
	1. ActionEvent
	2. ItemEvent
	3. ChangeEvent
	4. DocumentEvent
	5. ListSelectionEvent
	6. MouseEvent
	7. MouseMotionEvent
	8. KeyEvent
- most of these event objects passed in are objects with methods
- one of the most common methods is 
		
		public void actionPerformed(Action e){
		  if(e.getSource() == button 1){
                    ...  
                  }
		  else if(e.getSource() == button2){
                    ...
                  }
                  etc...
                }

***
###Day Split 11
***

- can't feed lambdas changing variables
- final is the same as const 
- captured variables are effectively final

- Threading
- Most things run on the event dispatch thread
- threads are created from runnables

***
###Day Split 12
***

- Threading is ideal for large tasks 
- Do not use stop, resume, or suspend for threads
- threads can be named 

***
###Day Split 13
***

- thread communication
- synchronization
- thread interlocking may cause odd issues.
- interlocking is when two threads change the same variable
- happens before relationships -- as it sounds
>> caused by waiting, synchronization, etc

- synchronizated methods
	
		public synchronized int value(){}

- all synchronized methods that are happening while a another is will block

***
###Day Split 14
***

- loop guard
	
		while(!var){
		  try{ wait();}
		   catch(InterruptExcetption e){}
		}

- jbar has jmenu objects
- key event

		KeyEvent e
		e.getKeyChar() -> 'a'
		e.getKeyCode() -> VK_A
		e.getKeyChar()	-> 'A'

***
###Day Split 15
***

- to make radio buttons work properly, they need to be added to a button group
- xml tags are cases sensitive
		
		<opening>
		</closing>
		<solo/>

- there are no rules for when to use attributes and when to use elements
- elements are generally better
- we will not check errors on downloading xmls
- to read it, we need a stringBuilder
	
		stringBuilder xmlResponse = new stringBuilder();

- to read the info

		BufferReader input = new BufferReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));

- to read the xml

		while((strLine = input.readLine() != null){
			xmlResponse.append(strLine); //creates a large string builder of all read data
		}

- now
		
		xmlString = xmlResponse.toString();

- errors
	
		MalformedURLException e
		IOException
		Exception

- then after all

		finally{if(urlConnection != null){urlConnection.disconnect();}}

- Parsing XML
- SAX - simple API for xml
- DOM - Document Object Model
- so

		Instantiate SAX
		Parse xml with .parse() from SAX lib
		Override methods of superclass for handling

***
###Day Split 16
***

- actions
- the information of an action can be bundled

- assignment 4 will focus on painting components
- never recall paint, always use repaint
	
		@Override
		protected void paintComponent(Graphics g){
			 super.paintcomponent(g);
		}

- components are built on components
- dimensions
- there is a getsize object for components
- they return a dimension object
- so, d.width, d.height
- top right is the 0 locale

***
###Day Split 17
***

- the only genre we care about is the first occurence of the category tag
- timer advice:
	
		Java Timer Class
		scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable r); //done in miliseconds

- recommend having an integer, and every second add one and update display
- he did it with two labels

		Elapsed time: actual time  //both of these are labels

- check stack overflow
- usually good practice to use

		toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().sync(); //use after drawing

- check his source for animation stuff

***
###Day Split 18
***

- XMLDownloadTask stores a reference to the XMLDownloadPanel
>>  that created it
- The Delegation Pattern -XMLDownloadTask stores a 
>> reference to an interface type. ("Delegate" reference)
>> XMLDownloadPanel implements that interface delegate.
>> Reference can be used to call methods declared in the interface
- Observer Pattern - XMLDownloadTask stores a list of event
>> references.
>> It has an "add listener" method that adds an event listener
>> to the list.
>> XMLDownloadPanel implements the event listener interface


		ArrayList<ActionListener> listeners = new ArrayList<>();
		void addActionListener(ActionListener l){
			listeners.add(l);
		}

>> when XMLDownloadTask encounters a situation that calls
>> for an event, it creates the event object,
>> and then calls a method for each listener, passing 
>> them the event object

		for(ActionListener l : listeners)
			l.actionPerformed(myActionEvent);

- logical fonts - only a handful, useful for cross-compatability 
- these fonts are mapped to specific fonts on the computer(LVM style)

***
###Day Split 19
***

- playing audio
- by default, java supports sun audio(.av extension), windows wave file format
>> .wav, mac aiff file format (.aif or .aiff), and midi file format(.mid, .rmi)

- the java media framework has more
- public void play(URL soundURL)
- public void play(URL location, string name)
- public void 	

		getDocumentBase() - url of html file
		getCodeBase() - url of applets .class file		

- images
- gif, png, jpeg
- image- abstract superclass for images
- buffered image - extends image to allow manipulation of image data

***
###Day Split 20
***

- streams are lambda calc based programming features
- check the class files if necessary
- runtime errors are considered unchecked MDTERM
- primative stream -> object stream
- .mapToObj(i-> "a" + i) - gives i1 i2 i3 i4 ... i(n)
- streams are verticle (no sorting in streams)
- streams can only be used once
- to resuse streams, create a streamSupplier

***
###Day Split 21
***

- high level concurrency objects
- look up executor services for more info (too bored to take notes)

***
###Day Split 22
***

- ps -u is userId option (for owned processes)
- for server compile then run java serverName &
- might be a good idea to pipe the std output into a logfile
- job shows job by job number
- foreground - fg %jobnumber

***
###FINAL REVIEW
***

####Schedule
- Friday 27 -- no class office hours - 9am - noon; 1-2
- Monday 30 -- pres
- Wednesday 2 -- pres
- Friday 4 -- no class
- Wednesday 9 -- pres
***

* threads
- create - new thread
- start - runnable
- terminated - when run stops

* paint repaint
- process
- repaint -- puts paint request into event queue
- repaint calls paint which calls overriddent paint component

* logical fonts like lvm -- maps to physical fonts

* networking
- serializable -- code uid and it needs to match
- ioexceptions occur with ObjectInput/Output Steams
- ObjectInput/Output Streams to objects or strings

***
* 30 questions total 
- 25 multichoice
- 5 code :networking databases
- nothing about the stream libraries
- no xml coding questions
- may be a multichoice on sax parsing
